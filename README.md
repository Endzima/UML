The launcher for Zenith, UNKN Multiplayer, and Oasis! Guess who pushed me into open sourcing it. E7 R1ft U6P!!!!!! Insane stuff bro, tried taking my Fortnite account and pulling it and admitting to cheating when I never.

For your information if you're reading this Chris, the code is fucking shit, and I could rewrite it 10 times better whenever I feel like it, this launcher is incomplete if you plan to use it for anything, it never worked.
Also, you did nothing to my account, I had my account rolled back in 20 minutes. You did nothing to me other than leverage shitty source code, and you can leave the GameServer and backend alone as they have nothing to do with your grudge against me that all started because you took shit that wasn't yours.

I ain't the victim, we are both wrong for what we did, but at the end of the day bro how the fuck did you think I was putting you on doxxbin, I don't even know how to get on there u melon.
Could have also just deleted code that wasn't yours as I trusted you to do so as a friend of mine, but you broke that trust too.

Doesn't matter tho, all ur socials are reported to Epic for pulling Fortnite accounts, ur VPS has Memz on it, and u have your own website with every single photo of you on it. Hope you're happy with the src mate! Learnt the only coding language I know with this launcher so it was a bit sentimental to me since I've been writing it for nearly a year until it was in a good state but you just had to take that from me too.
